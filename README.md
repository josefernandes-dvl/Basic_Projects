# Basic_Projects
Basic codes used to improve my learning in C#.  Exploring as many resources as possible, this repository aims to expose my journey and demonstrate my skills in a practical way.

# 1.Calculator 

  To develop my skills in features such as array, enum, for, while, if else, functions, variable, constant, type conversions, programming logic and others, I created 3 versions
  of the calculator. In version 3, I improved my skills in editing and programming with Windows Forms, with a fully
  interactive and full-function calculator.

# 2.Measurement Converter

  To improve my skills in using functions, parameters, returns, type transformations, logic and others, I also created 3 versions of the Measurement Converter. Furthermore, I
  improved my skills with Windows Forms with a more creative and interactive window, similar to Google's Unit Converter.
